Experiment 1 : Hello World LED Blinking
---------------------------------------

### Description :

_This is just a basic arduino experiment to blink a LED with a time interval of 1 second.  
A **Light-Emitting Diode (LED)** is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it._

_Like in the figure, longer leg is the positive side and the shorter leg is the negative side of the LED(Connect according to this in the circuit)._

_A **Resistor** is a [passive electrical component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component#Passive_components) with the primary function to limit the flow of electric current._

We should select our resistor according to the colour code. Here we are using a 220Ω Resistor which is a 4 band resistor whose colour code is Red,Red,Brown,Gold. To learn about colour codes visit this [site](https://www.atlearner.com/2019/07/Resistor-color-code.html).

### Components Used :

*   Arduino Uno Board
*   USB Cable
*   LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
*   220Ω Resistor x 1 Nos
*   Breadboard
*   Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) x 2 Nos

### Circuit Diagram :

_Connections are made according to the Circuit given_  
![Expriment 1](https://aswin-asokan.github.io/Kerala-IoT-Challenge/files/level1/images/Circuit1.png)

### Code :

    #define ledpin 10 //define digital pin 10
    void setup() { 
      pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT); //define pin with LED as output
    }
    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH); //LED on
      delay(1000); //wait for 1 second
      digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW); //LED off
      delay(1000); //wait for 1 second
    }
    

_Upload this code to the arduino._

### Video :

_The output of this experiment would be like this :_

_Even though it was just a basic experiment I was excited to do it as it was my first ever hands-on experience using Arduino. It was cool and made me more interested in working with it._
